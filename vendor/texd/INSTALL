# This file describes v0.3 of the TeX daemon

INSTALLATION OF THE TEX DAEMON
==============================

1.  Making the software

The command
    make
will compile the program dvichop.


2.  Testing the software

The command
    timetexd
will exercise the TeX daemon, and print some timing results.

It has been written for GNU/Linux, and may not work on other
UNIX platforms.


3.  Using the software

TeXpad and LaTeXpad are interactive 'calculators' for use with plain
TeX and LaTeX respectively.

The command 
    texpad
will start up TeXpad.  Type TeX commands in at the "Gimme:" prompt,
and the result in the xdvi window.  Give an empty response to quit.
LaTeXpad is used in the same way.


4.  Installing the software

Files have to be placed where the system can find them.  The
most important files are
    dvichop -- this should be placed somewhere in your path
    dvichop.sty -- this should be placed where (La)TeX can find it

The other files, "timetexd", "texpad" and "latexpad" are shell
scripts.  Please modify them to suit your own needs.  They typeset
"texpad.help" and "latexpad.help" do display help in xdvi.


5.  Obtaining an ipc enabled TeX (optional)

On small files, such as Don Knuth's "story.tex", TeX in daemon mode is
about seven times quicker than the usual batch mode.  

But we can do much better than this.  Lot's of time is wasted in
flushing TeX's output dvi buffer.  When this is eliminated a speed up
of 50 times compared to batch mode is possible.

For this, you will need a version of TeX that has interprocess
communication (ipc) enabled.  Actually, what we need is a TeX that
does not buffer the output dvi stream, and ipc is a pre-existing way
of getting that.

To discover if your version of TeX has ipc enabled, type
    tex --help
and if
    -ipc  send DVI output to a socket [...]
appears then you have ipc.

If you have ipc enabled, excellent.  (But at time of writing, this is
unlikely.)

The alternative is to build your own.  You have to rebuild TeX from
source, taking care to pass
    --enable-ipc
as a parameter to the build process.

Once you have an ipc enabled TeX, you should remove the flushing from
"dvichop.sty", and supply "-ipc" to TeX's command line.

The "texpad" and "latexpad" scripts do this automatically.
