[ANN]  texd 0.3, texpad 0.1, latexpad 0.1

texd 0.3 -- runs TeX in daemon mode, much quicker for small files
texpad 0.1 -- interactive evaluation of plain TeX expressions
latexpad 0.1 -- interactive evaluation of LaTeX expressions

TeX takes a little while to load, but will then typeset pages very
quickly.  Interactive applications typically typeset lots of small
items.  By running TeX in daemon mode, its start-up time can be
removed from the loop.

TeXpad and LaTeXpad are interactive applications of the TeX daemon.
The user enters material at a TeX prompt, which is then typeset and
displayed in xdvi.  They provide a sort of 'calculator' for (La)TeX.
The response is almost instantaneous.

The TeX daemon works with existing TeX distributions, and on small
files it is seven times quicker than batch mode.  If your version of
TeX has ipc (interprocess communication) enabled, the TeX daemon will
be about 50 times quicker than batch mode.

Instant Preview is similar to TeXpad, except that the input comes from
an Emacs buffer.  It provides a semi-wysiwyg interface to (La)TeX.
Previously, Instant Preview was distributed as part of the texd
package.  It has now been unbundled, and a new release is in
preparation.

This softare, released under the GPL, was developed under GNU/Linux,
and should run on all Unix platforms.
