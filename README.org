* CalcTeX
CalcTeX is a GNU Emacs minor mode that turns the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html][Emacs Calculator]] into a WYSIWYG
editor for LaTeX formulas.

** Why a WYSIWYG equation editor?
Much [[https://www.latex-project.org/about/][has]] [[https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-using-LaTeX-over-a-traditional-WYSIWYG-editor][been]] [[https://www.latex-project.org/about/][written]] about the virtues of LaTeX /not/ being a
What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get markup system. These arguments, however convincing
you find them, deal with LaTeX as a language for writing /text/ in. I have never
seen any kind of argument that the LaTeX development cycle is beneficial for
writing mathematics.

On the contrary, editing mathematics in LaTeX is, frankly, horrible. The
experience bears zero resemblance to writing on the page. Whereas editing text
on the computer is faster than handwriting, editing mathematics lags far behind
in terms of user experience. Consider the difference between writing out an
integral by hand,

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
[[file:resources/cos_theta.png]]

and typing the LaTeX source for that same formula:

#+begin_src latex
\int_0^\pi \cos\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta
#+end_src

The handwritten formula flows out of one's pen, and is a pleasure to write. On
the other hand, nothing about the LaTeX source code is ergonomic. The backslash
key is hard to reach, and long macro names and curly braces obscure the form of
the equation. When typing the formula, there is no visual feedback to remind you
where you are in the formula, alert you to any mistakes, or provide opportunity
for reflecting on the content of what you're typing.

*** A Tool of Thought
A good editor should be a [[http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf][tool of thought]]. Mathematical notation is the most
refined and sophisticated tool of thought in human history. When writing math on
the computer, we deserve an editor that *augments* the tool of mathematical
notation, not one that suffocates it.

*** No clicking
WYSIWYG equation editors typically provide large menus of clickable buttons.
A more powerful, Emacs-y alternative is key commands. CalcTeX is a display mode
for Emacs Calc, which provides a huge number of key commands for manipulating
equations.

* Installation
** External Binaries
Ensure that you have both the `latex` and `dvipng` ([[https://ctan.org/pkg/dvipng?lang=en][dvipng]]) binaries installed and on your `$PATH`. The [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][TeXLive]] distribution ships with both binaries.
** LaTeX Packages
CalcTeX makes use of a few LaTeX packages. To run CalcTeX with the default settings, make sure that you have the following LaTeX packages installed:
- xparse
- xcolor
- soul

Alternatively, you can modify the value of the `calctex-format-latex-header` variable:
```
(setq calctex-format-latex-header "...")
```
However, be aware that doing so may compromise some facilities of CalcTeX, particularly its selection handling.

* Usage
To fire up calc, invoke `M-x calc`, or `C-x * c`. `calctex-mode` will toggle the minor mode in the calc buffer. Change the calc [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual//html_node/calc/Language-Modes.html#Language-Modes][language mode]] to LaTeX with `d L`.

** Integrating with documents
CalcTeX is designed to be used in conjunction with calc's [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual//html_node/calc/Embedded-Mode.html#Embedded-Mode][Embedded Mode]]. In a LaTeX or Org buffer, move point to a LaTeX formula environment, and type `C-x * e` to invoke embedded mode. This will couple the top of the calc stack to the contents of the equation in the buffer you are editing.
